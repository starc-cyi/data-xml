data-xml
========

Main metadata files. One for objects and one for activities - to be cross referenced. These are used by the conversion scripts, as are the rest (files in datalists-ttl). So the following guides apply:

objects
-------

You may place any number of objects in a single file, or across multiple files. Just copy-paste/repeat the current object closure and populate with values. Details of how you specify the objects to convert will be given in the miminal-converter README file.

activities-resources
--------------------

As used with previous metadata files, except you may define multiple activities in any single file e.g. you may have photogrammetry and 3D scanning in the same file. Again, consult the minimal-converter's README file for details on how to specify the activities and resources for the scripts to convert.
